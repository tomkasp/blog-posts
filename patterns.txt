1. Template method.

You should use template method when you want to delegate some portion of the code functionality to the concrete implementation.
Let's say you have an abstract class which is a thread and has run method which is implemented inside this class. 
Beside of this methof you have also two other method like acquire and release. 
your run implementation looks like this

public void run(){
	
	acquire();
	//some stuff
	release();

}

In this case your template method is a run method an concrete implementation of the abstract class has implemetation for 
acquire and release methods.
